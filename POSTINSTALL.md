# Thank you for installing Cloudron-ZNC

ZNC is **not** yet integrated with the Cloudron user management.

The app comes with a pre-setup admin account with the following credentials:

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `changeme`

**Please change the admin password on first login!**

To login from IRC, you need to use port 6697 or the port selected during installation and SSL.

## Important

* Do not change the port number used for the web interface
* If you later choose to change your IRC port, make sure your the port used by ZNC matches the forwarded port number in Cloudron
